## Getting there

### By train 🚄

From **Paris**, on mornings and evenings, and in each direction, the [Paris-Lille TGV](https://www.trainline.fr/search/paris/lille/2019-09-20-06:00/2019-09-20-18:00) leaves every 30 minutes. We strongly recommend the 7:16 AM to get there early enough to fully enjoy the breakfast, or the 7:46 AM to be right on time for the first talk.

Prices for the train varies between €15 (if you buy tickets early) and €90 for last minute bookings.

When you get to Lille’s train station, count 25 minutes (tramway + walking) to get to the CITÉ des Échanges.


### By tramway 🚋 and on foot 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️

The closest station to the Cité, in walking distance, is Acacias (Marcq-en-Barœul). From Lille’ train stations (both stations are really close), take the tramway to Eurotéléport / Roubaix, which should take 12-15 minutes. 

To get the intinerary, you can head to [Ilevia](https://www.ilevia.fr/cms/institutionnel/se-deplacer/#itineraires) or see the [tramway map (PDF)](http://www.ilevia.fr/cms/institutionnel/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/01/tramway.pdf).

Once you get to Acacias, cross the residential area by taking the Avenue des Acacias (first one on your right). At the end of the Avenue, take a right to Rue Eugène Jaquet. Reaching house n°40, a sign “Entreprises et Cités” shows the entrance to the Cité — enter the facility and follow the main walkway to the Cité des Échanges.

## Pourquoi Lille ? 💡

- To decentralize the French Web, physically, so that all Web-related events do not take place in Paris. Last year we set camp at Bordeaux, this year it’s Lille. Who knows where we’ll be next year?
- If you don’t live up in the North of France, Lille is only one hour away from Paris by TGV and one hour and a half away from London & Brussels. And if you prefer flying, an airport is waiting for you!
- People are nice and friendly, and the beer is excellent.
